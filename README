# Ksysguard-Sensord #

<!-- TODO: Badges for coverage and test status -->

A ksysguardd-alike that exposes aribtrary configured sensor data to a querying ksysguard instance.
The protocol for the communication is described in: https://invent.kde.org/plasma/ksysguard/-/blob/master/ksysguardd/Porting-HOWTO

### Installation ###

The installation should be straightforward for most systems that include systemd.
Installing the compiled binary to `/usr/bin` as well as installing and enabling the systemd unit is sufficient.

The configuration of the sensors exposed by the daemon is expected in `/etc/ksysguard-sensord/config.d/`.
The daemon itself is configured in `/etc/ksysguard-sensord/config`.

### Configuration ###
